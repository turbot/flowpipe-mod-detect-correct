# Detect Correct Mod for Flowpipe

Detect/Correct pipeline library for [Flowpipe](https://flowpipe.io), enabling writing of standardized detect and correct control flows.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Download and install Flowpipe (https://flowpipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```sh
brew tap turbot/tap
brew install flowpipe
```

### Usage

[Initialize a mod](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/index#initializing-a-mod):

```sh
mkdir my_mod
cd my_mod
flowpipe mod init
```

[Install the Detect/Correct mod](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/mod-dependencies#mod-dependencies) as a dependency:

```sh
flowpipe mod install github.com/turbot/flowpipe-mod-detect-correct
```

[Use the dependency](https://flowpipe.io/docs/build/write-pipelines/index) in a pipeline step:

```sh
vi my_pipeline.fp
```

```hcl
pipeline "my_pipeline" {

  step "pipeline" "resolve_bad_item" {
    pipeline = detect_correct.pipeline.correction_handler
    args = {
      detect_msg      = "Detected an issue on item ${param.item_id}."
      default_action  = "delete_item"
      enabled_actions = ["skip", "delete_item"]
      actions = {
        "skip" = {
          label        = "Skip"
          value        = "skip"
          style        = "info"
          pipeline_ref = detect_correct.pipeline.optional_message
          pipeline_args = {
            notifier = "default"
            send     = false
            text     = "Skipped resolving item ${param.item_id}."
          }
          success_msg = ""
          error_msg   = ""
        },
        "delete_item" = {
          label        = "Delete Item"
          value        = "delete_item"
          style        = "alert"
          pipeline_ref = pipeline.delete_item
          pipeline_args = {
            item_id = param.item_id
          }
          success_msg = "Deleted ${param.item_id}."
          error_msg   = "Error deleting ${param.item_id}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

[Run the pipeline](https://flowpipe.io/docs/run/pipelines):

```sh
flowpipe pipeline run my_pipeline
```
